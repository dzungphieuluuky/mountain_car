# 🏆 RL Agent for MountainCar-v0

## 🎯 Overview
This project implements a **Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent** using **Q-learning** to solve **MountainCar-v0** from Gymnasium.

## 🚀 Key Feature
- Train using Q-learning
- Use Q-table to represent q-value of each state-action pairs.
- State discretization required.

## 🎖️ Architecture
- Environment: MountainCar-v0
- Discretization: discretize states into separate buckets.
- Q-learning: maxmize q-value over iteration

## 🌹 Dependencies (Windows)
```bash=
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
